Pubiç, an efficient client for Hubic
====================================

Pubiç provides a way to synchronize your data with your Hubic account.

Pubiç is the meeting of Python and Hubic. Yes, it's the same thing as Hubic, except for one hair. Pubiç is expected to be faster and much smaller than the official Linux client which originaly comes with mono. Features stay the same.

Unlike the official Linux client from OVH, Pubiç is made to be:
- simple
- reliable
- fast
- light


Features
--------

At this early development stage it only supports:

- authentication against Hubic services
- listing your Hubic containers and backups
- list your files stored in the main Hubic container
- search for a file/directory name pattern

It will soon provide:

- a fast and reliable way to download files
- a daemon mode to keep a folder synced with your Hubic cloud storage
- ability to manage backups


Install
-------

Requirements :

- probably creating an app key in your Hubic account
- Python 3.7 (backward compatibility will be considered later)
