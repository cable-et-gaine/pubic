Pubic, the client for OVH's Hubic cloud storage
===============================================

It is written in Python and is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3.

It is faster and much smaller than the official Linux client which comes with mono.

At this stage it only lists your files stored in the default Hubic container.

Requirements :

- Python
- create an app key in your Hubic account
- account login and password
