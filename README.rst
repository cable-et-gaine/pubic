Pubic, the client for OVH's Hubic cloud storage
===============================================

Pubic provides an efficient way to synchronize your data with your Hubic account.

Pubic is a pure Python software, and it is faster and much smaller than the official Linux client which originaly comes with mono.


Features
--------

At this early development stage it (only) supports:

- authentication against Hubic services
- listing your Hubic containers and backups
- list your files stored in the main Hubic container

It will soon provide:

- a fast and reliable way to download files
- a daemon mode to keep a folder synced with your Hubic cloud storage
- ability to manage backups


Install
-------

Requirements :

- Python 3.7 (backward compatibility will be considered later)
- creating an app key in your Hubic account
